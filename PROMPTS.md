What would be the minimal routes and JSON contracts for a chat Worker with sessions, chat, and history
How does Wrangler CLI work and how can I integrate it to make my chat worker functional?
How do I store per-session chat history in a Durable Object and read it back?
Show me how to call a Workers AI instruct model with messages and return a friendly error if it fails.
I have deployed my worker AI on cloudflare, but how do i integrate it locally, given that I have run npx wrangler login and am connected to my CF account?
How can I make a simple single-file chat UI (transcript + composer) that has relatively clean styling with an enter-to-send interface?
How does deployment work with wrangler; is there anything that needs to change in the toml file to deploy?
Add a safety rule: if asked for anything harmful, reply 'Sorry, I can't assist with that.
Help me make a concise readme file for this project, with instructions on deploying locally, as well as some details about what I've made here
